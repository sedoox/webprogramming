        <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
        <p id="about-me">I fell in love with technology and solving technical problems. I learned programming and specialized in this area in my early years of life. I found myself drawn towards Computer Science. After my graduation from high school I started as a corporate student at Deutsche Bank because I wanted to gain as much practical experience as possible. This led me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering with a minor in Cybersecurity.</p>
